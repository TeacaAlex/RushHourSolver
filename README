  Rush Hour Solver

  Requirements
    This project was tested on Ubuntu 12.10.

      -to run RushHourSolver you need JRE
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre
      -to compile java sources you need JDK
        sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk

  Getting Started
    To get started with RushHourSolver, you'll need to get familiar with Git.

    To initialize your local repository using the Spell Checker trees, use a command like this:
          $ git clone https://github.com/TeacaAlex/RushHourSolver.git
    Then:
          $ cd RushHourSolver/src/
          $ make
          $ make run

    "make run" calls "java RushHourSolver in.txt out.txt", where:
          in.txt = input file contains map to solve;
          out.txt = output file contains number of moves to solve in.txt, and
          each move required;

    maps contains 10 examples of input files;

    Encoding map:
        -a car that can move on direction right/left: "<"("-")*">";
        -a car that can move on direction up/down: "^"("|")*"v";
        -RED car is represented using "?";
        -parking wall is coded with "0";
        -exit is coded with "*";

    Input file format:
        -first line: n m
        -blank line;
        -next lines represent encoding map


    Output file format:
        -first line: number of moves performed by the nearest exit;
        -next lines: partial configurations of parking are displayed after each
        move in part;

    Implementation
        -solution to the game is to explore the states space using 
        a search algorithm informed by A*;
        -each state is uniquely determined by the vector of machines automobiles
        from Board;
        -the Heuristic I chose summarizes the number of cars in the path of Red
        car to the exit with the number of cars that are locked  vertically.
